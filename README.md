# Lipidomics of impacted microglia and mixed histiotypical cells

This project was generated with the manuscript "Impact Induces Phagocytic Defect in Reactive Microglia" [insert publication link]. Please see the manuscript for more details on the method & results. 

## Authors 

* Biological samples are generated by Ruilin Yu and Edmond A. Rogers.
* Lipidomics data is collected by Caitlin E. Randolph and Connor H. Beveridge using an Agilent 6410 Triple Quadrupole MS and pre-processed into csv files.
* Code is written by Ruilin Yu and Connor H. Beveridge.

## Usage

Download everything in a folder and run the code (.r files) in code folder sequentially:

1. 1_edger_analysis.r
2. 2_data_visualization.r

1_edger_analysis.r will perform EdgeR analysis with generalized linear model on the ion intensity data in data folder.  
2_data_visualization.r will visualize ion intensity data & EdgeR outputs in several formats, e.g. PCA, dot plot, bar plots, etc.
